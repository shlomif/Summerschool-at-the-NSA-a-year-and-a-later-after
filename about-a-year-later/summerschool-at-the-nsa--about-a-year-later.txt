* Summerschool at the NSA - roughly one year after
    - Snowden was baited - somone hired him despite his honesty and integrity.
    - Not all the Snowden documents may be factual.
        - someone may have wanted to make people overly paranoid and think
        too highly of the NSA.
    - Google/Facebook/etc. may not have cooperated with the NSA after all.
    - Snowden is innocent.
    - Snowden is a star and should act like one.
        - Give Ask Slashdot and Reddit "I am Edward Snowden - ask me anything"
        interviews.
        - Become the small fly that made the emperor who thought even God
        almighty (the King of the King of Kings) cannot stop him become mad
        and commit suicide.
        - Have fun - maybe move from Moscow to Leningrad.
    - Was the fact that the Snowden leaks were revealed shortly after writing
    the document a coincidence?
        - Maybe! But if we are to believe the old master turtle Oogway, from
        the [first in a series] film
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung_Fu_Panda (which is highly
        recommended) there are no conicidences.
        - It may not be cause and effect just an indication that "when it
        rains for the NSA it pours".
    - The Snowden NSA documents seem like the product of a maniacal mind (From
    mania-depressia) - not factual things.
        - there is only boasting - not actual exploits
        - I won't be surprised if some of the NSA workers developed it.
        - Seems like the NSA wants to feel all-powerful, while in fact it
        slowly became less and less competent.
    - Speaking of flies:
        - Attention:
            - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joss_Whedon
            - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Michelle_Gellar
            - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Glau
        - You can make the comeback of the decade,
            if you film http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/
                - You can either respect the CC-by-sa licence of the text,
        or pay me to make it (And the NSA facts) CC-by or PublicDomain/CC0.
        - Feel free to mutilate it beyond all recognition. ;-) Open culture
        (so-called "open content") for the win!
        - I want to show http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lawrence how
        we http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic_transit_gloria_mundi her!
        - (Actually, she can play the waitress, but the point still stands).
        - the real threat to the NSA comes from my captioned image, my NSA
        factoids, and my screenplay - not from the documents which Snowden
        revealed.
        - Let's kick the butt of those NSA dorks! (Who are not geeks or
        hackers by any meaning of the word.)
        - Moreover, if Mr. Whedon, Ms. Gellar and Ms. Glau are not interested,
        then the software/culture hackers world can emulate them. We can have
        stand-in actors, including ones in high school or even junior high. It
        can also be an animation. The possibilities with indie video are
        endeless.
            - Perhaps my prediction that someone underage will win the Acadmey
            Award for Best Actor/Actress in the future will come true soon: http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/#empowering_youth
